It is recommended to run a build project before starting to run the tests, it is an error that I have seen that is being shown repeatedly.

*We recommend that you open this README in a separate tab while performing the following tasks.*
*Setting dependencies:
Necessary dependencies have been implemented for the execution of tests using Rest Assured , TestNG , jUnit and Cucumber for java.*
*Database configuration:
Database has not been configured.*

*How to run tests:
A testRunner has been created which has been designed to execute tests with the tags.*
